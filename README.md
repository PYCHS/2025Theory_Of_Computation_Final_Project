# AI Relationship Analyst Agent (TOC 2025 Final Project)
An intelligent agent capable of analyzing chat logs to identify attachment styles and conflict patterns based on Gottman & EFT psychological models.

## Project Description
This project implements an AI Agent that acts as a relationship counselor. Unlike simple chatbots, this agent uses a State Machine workflow to process long conversation histories, identifies psychological features (Anxious/Avoidant attachment), detects vicious conflict cycles, and generates a comprehensive Relationship Health Report.

The system demonstrates advanced LLM usage, including Function Calling, Token Chunking, and Structured Output Generation.

## Key Features
* Psychological Profiling: Automatically extracts keywords to determine Attachment Styles (Secure, Anxious, Avoidant).
* Conflict Pattern Mining: Identifies negative interaction cycles (e.g., "Pursue-Withdraw" patterns).
* Intelligent Workflow: Uses an FSM to handle large datasets via chunking (intermediate state) rather than simple linear processing.
* Tool Usage: The LLM dynamically decides whether to perform psychological analysis or conflict mining based on context.

### Important Note (Please Read)

This project is hosted on Render's free tier. If the website is inactive for **15 minutes**, the server will automatically go to sleep to conserve resources.

**When you visit the link, you may see a loading screen similar to the image below. Please be patient and wait for about 30 seconds to 1 minute for the server to wake up.**

### Dual Mode Features

Once the site loads, you can switch between two modes using the buttons in the top-right corner:

### 1. Consultation Mode 📖 
This mode provides in-depth analysis. Please describe your relationship issue and provide actual chat logs. The system will use built-in psychological models to generate a detailed emotional analysis report for you.

### 2. Conversation Mode 💬 
This mode offers real-time interaction. You can chat with the AI companion for immediate responses and emotional support, just like talking to a friend.

### Note on Advanced Level Implementation
This project goes beyond the basic toy example by implementing:
* Complex State Transitions: Specifically the intermediate loop for handling token limits.
* Domain-Specific Prompts: Custom prompts engineered for psychological analysis (Gottman method).
* Dual-Tool Architecture: Separating individual attachment analysis from interaction pattern mining.

## How to Use Save Chat History and Load Chat History (Web UI)

### Save Chat History
1. Fill in the form: Your Name, Partner's Name, Context, and Chat Logs.
2. Click **Save Chat History**. The current chat session will be saved as a JSON file on the server.
3. A **Download Chat** button will appear. Click it to download the chat history (`.json` file) to your computer.

### Load Chat History
1. Click **Load Chat History**. A file picker will appear.
2. Select a previously saved chat history JSON file (e.g., `chat_xxx.json`).
3. The form will be automatically filled with the loaded chat data.
4. You can add new messages to the **Chat Logs** field.
5. Click **Save Chat History** again to save the updated chat session (it will create a new JSON file).

This workflow allows you to archive, reload, and append new messages to your chat sessions easily.
